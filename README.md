## Jeremy Sykes

Design Technologist in Toronto. I specialize in the systems, workflows, and tooling that connect design to code — design-to-code pipelines, token-driven theming, multi-brand governance, and AI-assisted development. My approach is facilitation over framework: integrating best-in-class tools rather than rebuilding what already works, and focusing on the architecture that lets teams scale design systems without friction.
